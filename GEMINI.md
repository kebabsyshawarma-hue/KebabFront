# Project Summary and Next Steps

This document summarizes the work completed and outlines the remaining tasks and future improvements for the Kebab website.

## Completed Work

### 1. Payment Gateway (Wompi) & Deployment Fixes
-   **Wompi Webhook:** Corrected import paths in `api/wompi.ts` and `api/setAdminClaim.ts`.
-   **SDK Compatibility:** Resolved Firebase Admin/Client SDK type conflicts in `api/wompi.ts`.
-   **Environment Variables:** Added robust build-time checks for critical environment variables in `api/_lib/firebase.ts` and `api/getWompiSignature.ts` to prevent deployment failures.
-   **Firestore Rules:** Updated `firestore.rules` to allow unauthenticated users to create orders (with `allow create: if true;`) and restricted read access to admins only.

### 2. Interactive Menu & Design Enhancements
-   **Quick View Modal:** Implemented a detailed modal (`MenuModal.jsx`) for menu items, showing larger images, descriptions, and an "Add to Cart" button.
-   **Modal Responsiveness:** Ensured the modal content (especially images) adapts to screen size without requiring scrolling.
-   **Modal Styling:** Styled the modal with a dark background, gold text, and red accents to match the website's theme.
-   **Decorative Element:** Added a red vertical rectangle to the left of the item names in both the menu modal and the main menu grid for visual elegance and consistency.

### 3. Order Status Tracking
-   **Secure Backend Endpoint:** Created `api/getOrderStatus.ts` to securely fetch sanitized order details for public viewing.
-   **Frontend Page:** Developed `src/pages/status/OrderStatusPage.jsx` for users to input an Order ID and view its status.
-   **Routing:** Added a dedicated route (`/status`) in `src/App.jsx`.
-   **Navigation Link:** Integrated a "Rastrear mi pedido" link into the website's footer for easy access.

### 4. Navigation Bar (Navbar) Improvements
-   **Responsive Structure:** Refactored `Navbar.jsx` to use a standard Bootstrap 5 responsive layout with a mobile toggler.
-   **New Links:** Added "Inicio", "Menu", "Contacto", and "Rastrear mi pedido" links to the navbar.
-   **Scrolling Integration:** Implemented smooth scrolling functionality for "Menu" and "Contacto" links.
-   **Styling:** Applied gold text color and a red background hover effect to the navbar links for consistent branding.

### 5. Contact Section Map Update
-   Updated the Google Maps `iframe` in `ContactAndFooter.jsx` with the new embed code.

## Next Steps & Remaining Tasks

### 1. Review and Enhance Admin Dashboard Order Management
-   **Current Status:** The `AdminDashboard.jsx` component already handles order listing and status updates.
-   **Task:** Review `AdminDashboard.jsx` to identify areas for improvement, particularly in light of the new public Order Status Page. This could include:
    -   Improving the display of order details.
    -   Ensuring all relevant order information is accessible to admins.
    -   Potentially adding more robust filtering or search capabilities.
    -   Ensuring the admin view is consistent with the new data structure (e.g., `customerDetails` vs `customerInfo`).

### 2. Micro-animations (Fade-in on Scroll)
-   **Current Status:** The fade-in-on-scroll animation for menu categories has been implemented in `MenuSection.jsx` and `menu.module.css`.
-   **Task:** User to test and confirm the desired visual effect.

### 3. Micro-animations (Add to Cart Animation)
-   **Current Status:** This animation was discussed but deferred due to its complexity.
-   **Task:** Implement a subtle animation when an item is added to the cart (e.g., a small image animating towards the cart icon). This is a lower priority but would add significant polish.
